# airbnb-data-analysis

Using the Inside Airbnb listings data for San Francisco, I was able to understand popular trends and predict SF listing prices given certain characteristics. 

Python Packages used in the project:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- mpl_toolkits
- matplotlib
 
This project is meant to give deeper understanding of the airbnb listing data, and introduce how powerful and convenient scikit-learn package's algorithm functions are.
